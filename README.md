# 01-Guessing
Guessing game for C-220 class that runs on python. This is my first project for the class, and works by inputting a number between 1 and 100. The program tells you if you are correct, or if your guess is higher or lower than the actual generated number. Once you guess correctly, it tells you how many guesses it took and asks if you want to play again.
